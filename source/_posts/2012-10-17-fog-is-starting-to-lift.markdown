Avi talks about the "fog of programming". There are so many different technologies at play in a web application, it's all overwhelming at first. Not only that, but since all the technologies interact with each other, you need to be comfortable with how all of them work.

As a result, new programmers feel like they're in a fog cloud, where they kind of understand how things work and interact with each other.

Then one day, you'll finally learn something, and you'll go back to those fuzzy concepts and you'll suddenly a ray of clarity will strike your mind and things start to come together more.

I'm really starting to understand classes, and how damn useful they are. I kind of understood classes and class methods, but I finally "saw the light" with instance variables and class methods.

A couple days ago, variable scoping really started to click in my head, and now I see instance variables, instance methods, and class methods in a whole new light.

It's quite a rewarding feeling.


Earlier in the semester, I wrote a very simple jukebox example, but have now rewritten it using object oriented code.

Here's the original:

<div style="max-width: 500px"><script src="https://gist.github.com/3909117.js?file=jukebox.rb"></script></div>

And here's the object oriented version:

<div style="max-width: 500px"><script src="https://gist.github.com/3909073.js?file=oo_jukebox.rb"></script></div>
