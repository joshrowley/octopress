I was perusing Speaker Deck and found [this great deck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/martinisoft/p/breakable-toys) by [Aaron Kalin](https://twitter.com/martinisoft) on learning programming through creating breakable toys.

There are some great suggestions he makes for beginning programmers who are trying to grow. A couple of the points are ones that I hear from [Avi]("https://twitter.com/aviflombaum") all the time.

What's a breakable toy?

As a newcomer to the software development field, the principles Aaron mentions are important to keep in mind for any new developer and I see how they relate to my experience:

1. <strong>"Go Simple"</strong><br><br> When given a coding challenge or project to implement, I tend to overthink it, or get too ambitious. I try to design my code to be open for all these awesome features I'd like to add. I try to implement everything at once, instead of doing small, basic, iterative steps. Also, when thinking of new projects I want to start, I try to think of next Facebook or amazing web app, but in order to grow as a developer I need to think of what small tools I could build that would be a great learning experience.

2. <strong>"They don't need to be perfect"</strong><br><br> For a lot of beginners, myself included, there's an intense urge to "get it right". There must be a perfect way of doing something. As I've become more immersed in the coding world, I've noticed that this is a destructive instinct. First, there are a million different ways to tackle a problem. Second, I need to being comfortable with sharing imperfect code with others. The worst thing is to work on code in isolation until the day I think it's "perfect". That day will most likely never come, and the code you wrote will never be used or shared.

3. <strong>"Consider open-sourcing them. It may help someone else learn"</strong><br><br> Pair programming at Flatiron school has been such a great learning experience. It's been extremely beneficial for me to code with another person. Going back to the previous points, even if your program is super simple and imperfect, share it with people! It's easy to forget that at one point, a former version of myself wouldn't have been able to do it, and would have searched for the answer online.

4. <strong>"Re-inventing the wheel is ok"</strong><br><br> With all the gems avaiable on Ruby, it's amazing that I can easily add some amazing functionality to my applications, even without a ton of experience. I now want to try my hand at building my own version of the sqlite3-ruby or nokogiri gems. Even though it's not necessary, it gives me projects I can work on, and gain further insight.
