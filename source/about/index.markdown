My name is Josh. I'm currently a Rubyist in Training [@flatironschool]('http://twitter.com/flatironschool')

In my previous life, I was "the IT guy" for a variety of New York's small businesses. In my free time, I started learning how to code through free courses on Udacity and Coursera. It was love at first sight, and I'm now thrilled to take the leap to become a pro with [Avi]('https://twitter.com/aviflombaum') and [Adam]('https://twitter.com/aenbar'). I'm especially happy to now be involved with a more creative area of the tech industry. It's wonderful to see the New York tech scene's amazing growth. I'm very excited to grow alongside with it.<

Besides pushing commits to GitHub, I enjoy [baseball]('http://sfgiants.com'), camping, and skiing.
